# Grok Ads Studio Track

**Focus:** Grok Ads Studio – Short-form ads and social video tools
**Track Lead(s)** : Parsa Tajik
**Office Hours Location (Sat 5pm - 9pm) -** Sequoia
**Track Slack channel:** #track-grok-ads
**Summary**
Build production-ready prototypes that meaningfully move the needle on the only two
metrics that matter in advertising: **traffic** and **conversions**. Use Grok to create,
personalize, optimize, or intelligently place ads — whether as standalone creative pipelines
(like AI video ads) or as an agentic advertising layer running directly on top of Grok itself.
**Description**
The best ads today are personalized, context-aware, and delivered at the exact moment of
intent. Grok’s unique strengths — real-time X data, deep reasoning, humor, multimodal
output, and conversational memory — make it the perfect platform to build the next
generation of advertising tools.
This track is deliberately broad: you can build full-stack ad creators (scripts → avatars →
video → captions), predictive optimization engines, real-time bidding agents, or an “ad
brain” that lives inside Grok chats and naturally surfaces sponsored solutions without
breaking user trust. Winning projects will clearly demonstrate how their system would
increase traffic, conversions, or both in the real world.
**Example project ideas**
● Heygen-style AI video ad studio: product URL → 50 personalized 15–60s video
variants with AI avatars, Grok-written scripts, dynamic visuals, and shoppable links
in <5 minutes
● Agentic ad layer inside Grok: Grok silently analyzes the conversation, detects
purchase intent, and injects perfectly-timed, native-feeling sponsored suggestions or
full video ads
● Real-time trend → conversion pipeline: detects trending X moments or viral audio,
instantly generates compliant ad creatives, and predicts performance, and suggests
bid amounts


● Conversion-rate prediction + auto-optimization agent: ranks hundreds of variants
before spend, then autonomously iterates based on simulated or live X post
performance
● “Ad Agency in a Chat” that runs full-funnel campaigns: user says “I need ads for my
new skincare line targeting Gen Z women” → Grok agent outputs strategy + 30
ready-to-post video ads + predicted CPA
● Contextual commerce injector: turns any Grok answer into a monetizable
opportunity by attaching relevant, non-annoying video ads or product carousels
**Resources & starting points**
● Grok API (structured outputs, tool calling, vision, image gen, agents):
https://docs.x.ai/docs/tutorial
● Grok Cookbook examples for marketing/agentic flows: https://docs.x.ai/cookbook
● Public trend data: TikTok Creative Center, YouTube Trending API, X Trends
● Video/avatar inspiration (allowed to integrate external APIs if they speed up your
demo): Heygen, Runway, Pika, ElevenLabs, etc.
**Judging criteria (in addition to general criteria)**
● Demonstrated impact on traffic & conversions (predicted, simulated, or real — the
clearer the better)
● Creative or technical ambition — how hard is this to replicate without Grok?
● Depth of Grok usage (reasoning chains, tool calling, real-time X context, multimodal,
memory)
● User experience & ethical integration — does the ad feel native, helpful, and
non-intrusive?
● Production readiness — could this ship next month?
